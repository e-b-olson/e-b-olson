### About Me

I am an **iOS engineer** with experience in **Objective-C** and **Swift**.  
My early career was spent in the video games industry as a gameplay engineer, working primarily in **C++**.  
That was a long, long time ago...  
  
These days I'm mostly working in **SwiftUI** or hacking together some **python** or **JavaScript** for a personal project in **django+postgres+react**.
